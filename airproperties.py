# This library contains functions for the properties of air.               #
# Most values for the pressure-independent properties come from the        #
# DIPPR(R) Public database, and the DIPPR(R) abbreviations are used.       #
# The density at 1 atm comes from a spline of the data found in the        #
# 7th ed. of "The Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer" by Bergman et.   #
# al. Density-related properties for the vapor phase use the DIPPR(R)      #
# and this spline function of the density data from Bergman et. al.        #              #                                                                          #
# The library can be loaded into python via the following command:         #
# import airproperties as air                                              #
#                                                                          #
# When imported in this way, the properties can be accessed as:            #
# air.tc for the critical temperature and air.vtc(t) for the vapor         #
# thermal conductivity at temperature t where t is in units of K.          #
# A complete list of properties, and the associated units, are found       #
# below.                                                                   #
